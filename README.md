# Cloud Computing Project: Elastic Face Recognition Application

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in cloud computing and software development by implementing an elastic face recognition application using AWS services. With a focus on scalability, efficiency, and reliability, I designed and implemented a multi-tiered architecture capable of handling varying workloads seamlessly.


By leveraging Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources such as EC2 instances, SQS queues, and S3 buckets, I created a robust system capable of processing user requests, performing face recognition tasks, and persisting data securely. The application demonstrates my proficiency in cloud architecture design, distributed systems, and backend development.

Key features of the application include dynamic autoscaling of the App Tier based on demand, efficient message queuing using SQS, and seamless integration with deep learning models for face recognition. Through rigorous testing and validation, I ensured the performance, reliability, and scalability of the application under different workload scenarios.

This project not only highlights my technical skills but also underscores my ability to design and implement complex cloud-based solutions that meet real-world requirements. It serves as a testament to my capabilities as a cloud architect and software engineer, showcasing my commitment to delivering high-quality and scalable solutions.

## Project Description

### Overview
In this project, I developed a robust cloud-based face recognition application leveraging Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application is structured into three tiers: Web Tier, App Tier, and Data Tier, each serving a specific purpose in the face recognition workflow. Key features include dynamic resource allocation through autoscaling, efficient inter-tier communication using SQS queues, and secure data persistence using S3 buckets.

### Web Tier
The Web Tier serves as the entry point for user requests and facilitates communication between users and the application. Implemented using Flask in Python, the Web Tier listens for incoming requests and handles concurrent file uploads, ensuring seamless user experience. Utilizing SQS for message queuing, the Web Tier efficiently forwards image data to the App Tier for processing while managing the autoscaling of the App Tier based on demand.

### App Tier
The App Tier is responsible for processing image data received from the Web Tier and performing face recognition tasks. Developed in Python with boto3 for AWS integration, the App Tier utilizes SQS for message handling and dynamically scales its resources to accommodate varying workloads. Leveraging a deep learning model for face recognition, the App Tier ensures accurate and efficient identification of faces in images while maintaining scalability and resource efficiency.

### Data Tier
The Data Tier manages the persistence of data generated by the application, storing input images and recognition results securely in S3 buckets. By leveraging the scalability and reliability of S3 buckets, the Data Tier ensures data integrity and accessibility, enabling seamless retrieval of stored images and recognition outcomes.
