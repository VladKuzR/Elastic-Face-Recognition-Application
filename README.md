# Cloud Computing Project: Elastic Face Recognition Application

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in developing a multi-tiered cloud application for elastic face recognition using AWS services. It demonstrates proficiency in cloud architecture design, implementation, and optimization for scalable and efficient performance.

## Project Description
In this project, I implemented a cloud-based face recognition application using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources from AWS. The application consists of three tiers: Web Tier, App Tier, and Data Tier. Key features include:
- Utilization of EC2 instances for web and app tiers.
- Implementation of autoscaling for dynamic resource allocation.
- Integration with SQS queues for inter-tier communication.
- Persistence of data using S3 buckets.
- Utilization of a deep learning model for face recognition.

## Components and Technologies Used
### Web Tier
- Implemented using Flask in Python.
- Utilized SQS for message queuing.
- Handled concurrent requests and file uploads.
- Managed autoscaling of App Tier.

### App Tier
- Developed in Python with boto3 for AWS integration.
- Utilized SQS for message handling.
- Used deep learning model for face recognition.
- Ensured scalability and efficient resource management.

### Data Tier
- Managed data persistence using S3 buckets.
- Stored input images and recognition results.
- Ensured data integrity and accessibility.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented a scalable face recognition system.
- Achieved dynamic resource allocation with autoscaling.
- Ensured data persistence and reliability using AWS services.
- Demonstrated proficiency in cloud computing architecture and development.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my expertise in cloud computing, particularly in designing and implementing scalable and efficient cloud applications. It highlights my skills in AWS services, Python programming, and system architecture design. I am excited to continue exploring and mastering cloud technologies to tackle future challenges in this dynamic field.
